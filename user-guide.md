## 2. How to Use Zoho Google Maps

Our extension adds mapping capabilities directly into your Zoho dashboard.

### Mapping a Single Record

Quickly see where any specific contact, lead, or account is located.

1.  Navigate to any record in a supported module (e.g., Contacts, Leads, Accounts).
2.  In the record's detail view, click the **"View on Map"** button located near the address field.
3.  A popup window will appear, displaying a Google Map centered on the record's address.

### Mapping Multiple Records from a List View

Visualize an entire list of customers or prospects at once.

1.  Go to the list view of any supported module (e.g., Contacts).
2.  Select the checkboxes next to the records you wish to map.
3.  Click the **"Actions"** button (or similar bulk action menu).
4.  From the dropdown menu, select **"Plot Selected on Map"**.
5.  A full-screen map will open, displaying a pin for each selected record.

### Planning a Route

Once you have multiple records plotted on the map, you can create an optimized route.

1.  After plotting multiple records, you will see a list of the locations on the side of the map.
2.  Click the **"Create Route"** button.
3.  The extension will automatically calculate the most efficient route to visit all the selected locations.
4.  You can then click **"Send to Google Maps"** to open the route on your phone or in a new browser tab for turn-by-turn navigation.

### Filtering Data on the Map

When viewing a map of multiple records, you can use the **"Filter"** option to show or hide pins based on data in Zoho (e.g., filter by "Lead Status" or "City").

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Which Zoho modules are supported?**
A: The extension supports all standard modules with address fields, including Contacts, Leads, Accounts, and Deals. Support for custom modules can be configured.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. We do not store your Zoho data. The extension reads address information in real-time to plot on the map and operates under the security permissions you grant during installation. For more information, please see our [Link to your Privacy Policy].

**Q: Do I need to pay for Google Maps?**
A: The extension requires a Google Maps API Key, which is tied to your own Google Cloud account. Google provides a generous free tier for API usage, which is sufficient for most small to medium-sized businesses. Any costs beyond the free tier are billed directly by Google.
